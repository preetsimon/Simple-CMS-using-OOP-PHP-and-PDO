# Simple-CMS-using-OOP-PHP-and-PDO
Project Description
My project is a Content Management Web App that displays the blog acticles about outdoor activities near Vancouver,BC. The web site hosts outdoor activity blogs that can be categorized in four fields namely hiking, skiing, boating and biking. Each category contains blogs that contain details like title, location, content, image and author. All articles are loaded dynamically from the database using PHP and SQL. The web-apps functionality depends on the type of login credentials, casual users or admin.

The user must register\login to gain access to the website content. The user is allowed the following privelleges:
- Read a specific article in detail by clicking on it. 
- Navigate to a specific category to check all articles in that category.
- Click on the Authorâ€™s name to check all articles written by that Author.
- Search articles by entering keywords.

The admin can login to create, edit, and delete the articles. The admin is shown the total number of articles present in the database. The admin may create a new article by adding the title, location, author, image, content and category for the blog article. Similarly, admin may edit all the above attributes using the HTML forms. The admin may choose to hide the article on the website by choosing to not display in the editing page. These forms, together with PDO, communicate with database to reflect the changes made by the admin.
